9. You forgot the `l` at the end of `bool` 
10. `==` should be `!=`
11. `==` should be `!=` and you missed a `<` on `cout <<`
12. `if(s+"fool")` causes an error.  Should be `if(s!="fool")`
13. Infinite loop checking if `0<v.size()`, should be `i<v.size`
14. No error.  Compiles and runs perfectly.
15. `s` is not an array, so you can't `cout << s[i]`.  Should just be `cout << s`
